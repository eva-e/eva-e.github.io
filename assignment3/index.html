<!-- Monstera Plant, Bonsai Plant, Small Snake Plant -->
<!-- Premise of game has changed, there will be three plants shown, empty pots, 
     user presses watering can and all plants grow, 
     allowing user to drag all plants one at a time on the shelves, 
     rather than choosing one at a time, a quick and easy mini game -->

<!-- PLAN 10th-13th June: Start by creating the plant icons and watering can. 2. Write the JS for drag and click functions. 
 3. Make the background of the plant shop and create the logo to be centre aligned and middle top of page. 
 4. Refer to wireframe for design layout. 5. Write the layout using css -->

<!-- Concept Notes From My Presentation -->
<!-- Assignment 3 - I have chosen two actions, click and drag. My context is a web browser game. -->
<!-- weBloom, a mini plant nursery, will be a web browser game, utilising the drag and click actions. 
   The name of my mini game correlates with the themes of selflessness and blooming and growing collectively, signifying how our fruitful words and actions benefit those around us, therefore we all grow. 
   The game itself will centre around the theme of growth. In terms of the interaction features, clicking the Watering Can waters the plant, which changes the pot from empty, to a fully grown plant. 
   The time and stages of growth for the plant may be added to my prototype however at this point I am still deciding on this. For the drag action, 
   the user will be able to drag the pot to a spot on the shelf to decorate the shop, as well as changing the colour of the pot. 
   As my chosen context is a game, the focus is on how these interactions guide the user towards decorating the shop. 
   Clicking the Watering Can button produces a desired outcome, a plant in the pot to decorate the room, therefore the user is inclined to add another plant to the room. 
   The user will then rely on two buttons, adding another plant and watering the plant. I am also deciding on whether I will have the pots displayed or a separate button to add a new pot. 
 -->

<!-- Website Layout Update -->
<!-- In my presentation I mentioned: I have created a rough visual plan for my interactive web browser in Figma. 
  This is a draft layout design which encapsulates the main aspects of the page. 
  I have annotated the buttons, images and items which are clickable and draggable for the user. 
  I haven’t represented each element in depth as I am in the process of developing the design. -->
<!-- Since my presentation and taking note of lecturer and class feedback, I have responded by implementing a new button layout. 
 Instead of the two buttons, one for add a plant and one for a watering can, I decided on three separate draggable icons for three plant types. 
 The user is then able choose their desired plant and then proceed to press the other button which is the watering can, 
 for it to show the fully grown plant. Initially, the user is given three plant pots.
 Once they press the watering can next, the pots will change into a fully grown plant pot.-->
