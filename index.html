      Question 1<br />
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Upon viewing the website, I was first drawn to the main heading or opening
      headline, which is written in a large and bolded font. At this point I was
      unsure about the purpose of this site as the first set of text I paid
      attention to was an opening line about the author. Furthermore, my eyes
      were first directed to the main headline due to the style and large size
      of it, especially how each word in the headline started with a capitalised
      letter, which I perceived as a standout headline carrying great
      importance.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-2">Course-Specific Learning Outcomes:</h3>
    <p>
      During the two minutes of interacting with the site my discrete actions
      are as follows: First I clicked onto the “Explore Projects” button and was
      taken to the featured projects section. I noticed the cursor change,
      indicating the first project was clickable and I clicked into the project,
      it displayed further details about this specific project. I was unsure
      what to do next here as the heading on this page was a little unclear. I
      noticed a link below the header and clicked on it leading to an external
      site, which opened on a separate page. I closed the external site page and
      returned to the website tab. I scrolled further down to read the author’s
      progress throughout this project. I reached the bottom of the page and
      another section “Other Projects” appeared, however this time I wanted to
      know about the author rather than continuing to explore their projects.
      Initially, I was guided towards their projects rather than their “About
      Me”. I looked in the top right and clicked “About”. I read the About Me
      and clicked onto the “See Resume” to learn more, as the footer was
      covering a little part of their “Experience” and “Honors & Awards”
      section. The “Resume” opened on the same tab without opening on a separate
      tab. I clicked the back button on the browser. Once back on the website, I
      clicked the home button in the top left corner. Finally, I scrolled down
      to view the graphic which was slightly below the main headings.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-3">Course-Specific Learning Outcomes:</h3>
    <p>
      I spent the most time engaging with the “Projects” section, as this
      section was frequently featured on the site. The first action I made on
      the site was clicking the “Explore Projects” button, leading me to
      multiple projects and many screenshots. The project's descriptions and
      related images were quite extensive, accounting for the time spent in that
      part of the experience.
