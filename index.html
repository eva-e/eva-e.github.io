      Question 1<br />
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Upon viewing the website, I was first drawn to the main heading or opening
      headline, which is written in a large and bolded font. At this point I was
      unsure about the purpose of this site as the first set of text I paid
      attention to was an opening line about the author. Furthermore, my eyes
      were first directed to the main headline due to the style and large size
      of it, especially how each word in the headline started with a capitalised
      letter, which I perceived as a standout headline carrying great
      importance.

    <h3 id="question-2">
      Question 2<br />Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of
      each of your discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the two minutes of interacting with the site my discrete actions
      are as follows:
      <li>
        First I clicked onto the “Explore Projects” button and was taken to the
        featured projects section.
      </li>
      <li>
        I noticed the cursor change, indicating the first project was clickable
        and I clicked into the project, it displayed further details about this
        specific project.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was unsure what to do next here as the heading on this page was a
        little unclear. I noticed a link below the header and clicked on it
        leading to an external site, which opened on a separate page.
      </li>
      <li>
        I closed the external site page and returned to the website tab. I
        scrolled further down to read the author’s progress throughout this
        project.
      </li>
      <li>
        I reached the bottom of the page and another section “Other Projects”
        appeared, however this time I wanted to know about the author rather
        than continuing to explore their projects. Initially, I was guided
        towards their projects rather than their “About Me”. I looked in the top
        right and clicked “About”.
      </li>
      <li>
        I read the About Me and clicked onto the “See Resume” to learn more, as
        the footer was covering a little part of their “Experience” and “Honors
        & Awards” section.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “Resume” opened on the same tab without opening on a separate tab. I
        clicked the back button on the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once back on the website, I clicked the home button in the top left
        corner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, I scrolled down to view the graphic which was slightly below
        the main headings.
      </li>
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-3">
      Question 3<br />What part of the experience did you spend the most time
      engaging with?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I spent the most time engaging with the “Projects” section, as this
      section was frequently featured on the site. The first action I made on
      the site was clicking the “Explore Projects” button, leading me to
      multiple projects and many screenshots. The project's descriptions and
      related images were quite extensive, accounting for the time spent in that
      part of the experience.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 id="question-4">
      Question 4<br />What was the most common action in your two minute
      interaction with the experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      During the two minutes I was mostly scrolling and clicking on buttons,
      links or project cards. The buttons allowed me to navigate to different
      sections of the site, however at times I was faintly lost. Overall,
      clicking buttons was my most common action, making it easier to progress
      through the site rather than constant scrolling. Indeed I found myself
      scrolling quite a lot also, which is not out of the ordinary when being
      presented with several sections of text and images.

    <h3 id="question-5">
      Question 5<br />What is your impression of the intended primary goal of
      the interactive experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I perceived the site to be a project portfolio, bringing awareness to an
      individual's achievements, experiences, skills and career milestones,
      especially their passion and dedication. I also sense the author intended
      it to be a minimalist site and simple navigational experience for user's,
      with a focus on the author's project experience. My final impression,
      which I believe the author may not have intended, was how their About Me
      and Resume were not exactly given direct attention, compared to their
      projects.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 id="question-6">
      Question 6<br />How does the interactive experience communicate this
      primary goal?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The experience is able to communicate this primary goal, by the use of
      highlighted buttons and the recurring feature of project sections. Not
      only was there a “Featured Projects" section, there was also “Other
      Projects”, and additionally, a “See all projects” button, a common theme
      across the site. Each project included multiple images and descriptions
      encapsulating the depth of the author's experience within their projects
      and passion for their field. The detailed nature of each project signals
      and communicates to me as a user of the site that they are dedicated and
      enthusiastic about their career and gaining knowledge.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-7">
      Question 7<br />What is your impression(opinion) of how the experience
      should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different
      times)
    </h3>

    <p>
      As this site is a project portfolio, the option of seeing the author's
      resume shouldn't be featured on the home page, as this is an unnecessary
      button, distracting from the main intended experience of the user,
      consequently taking more time. There are duplicates of the sections,
      “Projects” and “About Me”. These navigation links are not needed due to
      the “Projects” and “About Me” being featured already on the main page. My
      opinion is that the site should be interacted with for 10-15 minutes, one
      to three times. The explore projects button could link to the projects
      section on the main page without navigating to a separate page. The
      experience shouldn't take too much time, as the website sections should be
      easy to access and navigate to.

    <h3 id="question-8">
      Question 8<br />How does the interactive experience communicate how it
      should be interacted with over time?
    </h3>

    <p>
      By taking note of the large amount of information for each project and
      links, the experience communicates it should be interacted with for around
      over 20 minutes, once. While the author has already included in their
      about me details, “Experience” and “Honors & Awards”, they have
      additionally attached a link to their resume, duplicating this information
      and increasing the time spent in this section.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 id="question-9">
      Question 9<br />What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
      experience reference?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The experience references a news website, “Forbes” and a blog page,
      “Waymo", in relation to the author's projects and includes two digital
      graphic illustrations. The digital graphic depicts the author drawing an
      array of icons representing their expertise in user experience design. The
      news articles and blog relate to their project, an additional source
      informing users of the author's projects.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 id="question-10">
      Question 10<br />What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
      you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The references force me to act by clicking into the link to further my
      understanding of the author's project, as it mentions that the link is a
      related news article and draws my attention to it being placed at the top
      of the page. The use of this link enables me to gain a better
      understanding of the author's project from another perspective and compare
      how both are related. The graphic featured on the home page below the main
      heading seemed clickable and interactive however was not.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-11">
      Question 11<br />What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
      you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I feel reassured by the information provided and it validates the
      authenticity of the author's projects. I also feel a little overwhelmed by
      the immense amount of information being presented, however it conveys that
      the author is dedicated to their field. The digital graphic illustration
      is an artistic and creative addition, which should make me feel intrigued
      by the site and stray away from it being too plain.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-12">
      Question 12<br />What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to
      you and what makes that part frustrating?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I noticed a few parts of the interaction which were unnecessary and
      frustrating. Firstly, the timeline of projects was unclear and unorderly,
      making the interaction with each project quite confusing and a
      disorganized way of presenting projects in a grid layout that varied in
      size, which was not consistent. There were many sections to click into and
      duplicates, such as the projects and about me on two separate pages when
      they were both already on the first home page. Lastly, the navigation bar
      was very distant from the central focal point, it was pushed to the top
      left and right corners. Home, Projects and About would not be noticed
      clearly and seem unimportant upon interacting with the site.
    </p>

    <h3 id="question-13">
      Question 13<br />What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to
      you and what makes that part satisfying?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I found the home button was the most satisfying part of the site. Many
      sites don't include a way out of certain pages, causing the interaction to
      become confusing and stressful. The ability to navigate back to the home
      page at all times on every page was relieving and especially useful when
      lost deep within page links. It adds relief to the interaction, as I can
      rely on the home button to return back to the main page rather than
      endlessly looking for a way out or pressing the back arrow on my browser.
